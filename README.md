# EVT-Challenge

Introduction:
In this Repo (master branch) is the working directory.
I decided to use Docker to containerize an Nginx webserver image and copy my directory to it when creating my own image.
I had never used Nginx before this, but it was fun to figure out how to set up the server .config and Dockerfile (This was also my first time using and creating a docker file from scratch).
